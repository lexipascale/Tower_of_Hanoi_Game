# Tower_of_Hanoi_Game
I created this game as a class project. it is a puzzle game that has of three rods (Left, Middle, Right) and a number of disks of different sizes, which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest at the top.

The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following rules:

- Only one disk can be moved at a time.
- Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.
- No larger disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

The user can choose how many disks they would like to play with as long as there is more than 3 disks.
The game will give the user the optimal amount of moves the game can be played in, and at the end it will tell the user how many moves they used.

Can you beat the can in the least amount of moves possible?
